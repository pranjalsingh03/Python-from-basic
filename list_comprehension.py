# List Comprehension

'''List comprehension in Python is a compact way of creating a list from a sequence. It is a short way to create a new list. List comprehension is considerably faster than processing a list using the _for_ loop.'''

#Example:1

'''For instance if you want to change a string to a list of characters. You can use a couple of methods. Let's see some of them:'''


# One way
language = 'Python'
lst = list(language) # changing the string to list
print(type(lst))     # list
print(lst)           # ['P', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']

# Second way: list comprehension
lst = [i for i in language]
print(type(lst)) # list
print(lst)       # ['P', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']

#Example:2

'''For instance if you want to generate a list of numbers'''

# Generating numbers
numbers = [i for i in range(11)]  # to generate numbers from 0 to 10
print(numbers)                    # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# It is possible to do mathematical operations during iteration
squares = [i * i for i in range(11)]
print(squares)                    # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

# It is also possible to make a list of tuples
numbers = [(i, i * i) for i in range(11)]
print(numbers)                             # [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)]
