## Day06 - Tuples

'''A tuple is a collection of different data types which is ordered and unchangeable (immutable). Tuples are written with round brackets, (). Once a tuple is created, we cannot change its values. We cannot use add, insert, remove methods in a tuple because it is not modifiable (mutable). Unlike list, tuple has few methods. Methods related to tuples:

- tuple(): to create an empty tuple
- count(): to count the number of a specified item in a tuple
- index(): to find the index of a specified item in a tuple
- + operator: to join two or more tuples and to create a new tuple'''

# Empty tuple: Creating an empty tuple
# syntax
empty_tuple = ()
# or using the tuple constructor
empty_tuple = tuple()
