# Day09-Conditionals

'''Conditionals'''

#By default, statements in Python script are executed sequentially from top to bottom. If the processing logic require so, the sequential flow of execution can be altered in two way:

# Conditional execution: a block of one or more statements will be executed if a certain expression is true
# Repetitive execution: a block of one or more statements will be repetitively executed as long as a certain expression is true. In this section, we will cover _if_, _else_, _elif_ statements. The comparison and logical operators we learned in previous sections will be useful here.

'''If Condition'''

#In python and other programming languages the key word _if_ is used to check if a condition is true and to execute the block code. Remember the indentation after the colon.
