## Functions

'''So far we have seen many built-in Python functions. In this section, we will focus on custom functions. What is a function? Before we start making functions, let us learn what a function is and why we need them?'''

### Defining a Function

'''A function is a reusable block of code or programming statements 
designed to perform a certain task. To define or declare a function, 
Python provides the _def_ keyword. The following is the syntax for 
defining a function. The function block of code is executed only if 
the function is called or invoked.'''

### Declaring and Calling a Function

'''When we make a function, we call it declaring a function. When 
we start using the it,  we call it *calling* or *invoking* a function. 
Function can be declared with or without parameters.'''
