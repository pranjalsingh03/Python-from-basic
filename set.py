## Sets

#Set is a collection of items. Let me take you back to your elementary or high school Mathematics lesson. The Mathematics definition of a set can be applied also in Python. Set is a collection of unordered and un-indexed distinct elements. In Python set is used to store unique items, and it is possible to find the _union_, _intersection_, _difference_, _symmetric difference_, _subset_, _super set_ and _disjoint set_ among sets.
